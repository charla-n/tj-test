# Candidate test
### This project uses ASP.NET and ReactJS/Redux. 

* To build **PairingTest.Web** you need *NodeJS* and *Webpack* to generate bundles (you should be able to run the project without generating bundles as they are already included in the repository). You can also have a look at the file *package.json* to see all libraries used in the project.
* The project **PairingTest.Web** uses *Jest* to run unit tests. Running *npm run test* will run all tests as shown in the following screenshot (https://imgur.com/a/XTVq6)
